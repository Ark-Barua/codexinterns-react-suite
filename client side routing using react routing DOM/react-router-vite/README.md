# React Router Starter App

A **React** single-page application (SPA) scaffolded with React Router, providing navigation between Home, About, and Contact pages. Includes a fallback NotFound route for undefined paths.

## Features

- **React Router v6** integration
- **Navigation** between:
  - Home
  - About
  - Contact
- Automatic **NotFound page** for unmatched routes
- Modular page structure (each page in its own file)

## Project Structure

```
/src
  /pages
    Home.jsx
    About.jsx
    Contact.jsx
    NotFound.jsx
  App.jsx
  index.js
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone 
cd 
npm install # or yarn install
```

### Launch the Development Server

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```
The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

## App.jsx Overview

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import About from "./pages/About";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";

function App() {
  return (

        Home
        About
        Contact

  );
}

export default App;
```

## Notes

- This boilerplate expects individual page components (`Home`, `About`, `Contact`, `NotFound`) in the `/pages` directory.
- Navigation links are provided in a `` bar for user experience.
- All routing logic is handled in `App.jsx` using `react-router-dom` v6 conventions[2].

## Customization

- Add new routes or pages by creating a new component and updating the `` block in `App.jsx`.
- Modify navigation as needed for your layout.
